      As parents, we know that it can be hard to get a child to pay attention -
      especially when we are trying to teach them something. Playing games can
      be a great way to keep their focus, and our bingo game will do just that.
      Try to fill every box in a row - horizontal, vertical, or diagonal - and
      have fun reading.
